# Sandboxels-Mod-Icons
Repository for icons of Sandboxels mods.

# Guidelines
Mod creators or other authorized people can upload an icon for a mod here.

* File format must be PNG.
* Image ratio must be square (1:1) and good quality.
* File names must be the same as the mod file name, but with _.png_ instead of _.js_. For example, the icon for _classic_textures.js_ would be at _classic_textures.png_.
* Upload files into the _icons_ directory.

# Recommendations
* A standard icon is a 32x32-Sandboxels-pixel square that shows some of the elements or other additions of the mod, but feel free to be creative.
* The _ModIconTemplates.sbxls_ save file is included to help you create these standard icons.
