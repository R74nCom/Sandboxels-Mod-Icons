# Sandboxels-Mod-Icons
Repository for icons of Sandboxels mods.

# Guidelines
Mod creators or other authorized people can upload an icon for a mod here.

* File format must be PNG.
* Image ratio must be square (1:1) and good quality.
* File names must be the same as the mod file name, but with _.png_ instead of _.js_. For example, the icon for _classic_textures.js_ would be at _classic_textures.png_.
* Upload files into the _icons_ directory.

# Recommendations
* A simple icon would consist of one or more elements added by the mod, but you're free to be creative.
